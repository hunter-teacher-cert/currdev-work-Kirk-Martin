9-12 IC 1  Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.

Students will be asked to research an assigned computer scientist and research them. They will discover what their impact is either regarding programming, algorithms, software, hardware, internet and many other topics that this person was involved in. They will be asked to create a presentation to their classmates so that all will gain some knowledge on the history of these computer scientists and their impact in those fields.
Example portion of the lesson  below:
Directions: Choose one of the famous computer scientists listed below. Create a PowerPoint presentation about this person and what they helped to create or design. Your PowerPoint should have the following.

There should be a minimum of 5 – 8 slides in your presentation.
When were they born? Where were they born?
Where did they receive their education?
What are they famous for in the computer science field?
Did they receive any special awards or achievements? 
How can you relate the impact of what they created to what we use in society?
There should be 4 to 5 lines of information per slide. The intro slide does not need to have this many lines.
Have at least 3 images of the computer scientist you have been assigned.

Career Paths 9-12 IC.7  
Investigate the use of computer science in multiple fields. The focus on making connections between computer science and the fields of interest of individual students.

Summation: Students will be asked to research two computer fields they have an interest in. Once making the presentation they will search what the job is, the skills, knowledge, education involved as well as the pay scale. This will help to broaden the students’ knowledge of the various occupations in the computer science field.

Example of the lesson given below.

Create a PowerPoint Presentation based on your answers for the questions below. You are not limited to these questions in creating your presentation. You should do a compare and contrast for your two Computer Science jobs in your presentation.
Minimum 10 slides.
