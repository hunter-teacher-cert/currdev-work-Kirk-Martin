## Assignment
* title: **04_langauge.md**
  * Select one of the languages that were discussed in the breakout rooms that you feel would be a good fit for a course that you currently teach or would like to teach. (If it is reasonable, pick a language other than one you currently teach.)
  * Answer the following prompts:
    - 
1.)	What is the course? 
The course would be an introductory course to programming for freshman students or those that have no programming experience.

2.)	What is the language?
The language is JavaScript.

3.) How does one write & run code in this language?
You can write code using an online editor such as P5.js, Replit or CodeHS to name a few.

4.) Rate the complexity of the syntax? The syntax is not that complex at its introductory phase but offers immediate visual feedback results with successful working code.
5.) How would you utilize the strengths in the class? 
I would use the strengths of this program by having students create basic codes that would show carious shapes and animations.

6.) Weaknesses 
Weaknesses may be that the program would be to basic for established programmers and some code function would be bundled already without students knowing the full details of what makes it work properly.
7.) How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?
I would mitigate the weaknesses by showing students more complex code in Python and Java that uses the same type of function but show the programming detail that goes into it
   
8.) Why did you select this language for this class?
I selected this language because at my school we have been looking for languages that are not too complicated but not as much block based like Snap or Scratch.
