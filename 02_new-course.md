Topic :Game Design in C++
Course: Programming in C++
Students: Junior and Seniors that have completed a programming language such as Python and Java

Why you chose this particular topic:?
 I feel a course of this type would grab students attention because they would have an interest in programming something they can relate to being video gaming. 

What computer science curricular needs does this topic fill:
They would learn object oriented programming and relate movements in a gaming situation to actual code they design.

 C++ is one of the top game-developing languages., especially because it's such a popular, flexible solution. C++ is known for its high abstraction level, which allows you to have precise control over how a computer's hardware interacts with your code.

C++ also provides more granular control over how graphics are processed by the system, which plays a very important role in game design.
Another key benefit of using C++ is it allows you to optimize special parts of your game design, giving them their own abstractions.  This level of detailed game development is difficult, if not impossible, with many other languages.
It has played a huge role in the coding of countless games, and has been among the most popular programming languages since its creation–all the way back in 1998!
C++ has great performance. It is a compiled language, instead of an interpreted coding language, which makes it nearly as fast as the computer’s speed itself.
The Influence of C++ in Gaming
Video games can sometimes have hundreds of thousands of lines of code being processed by the games engine, and if the programming language used to write this code is too slow, it can impact a game’s experience.

Due to its speed, C++ has had the greatest impact on the creation of game engines. Unity, Unreal, and Frostbyte were all created using C++ game programming.
That’s mainly why C++ game development has nearly become the default for embedded code.
Examples of C++ Video Games
Counter-Strike, Diablo 2, Doom–essentially if it is a AAA gaming title, the creators used C++ at some point during the development process. Games always want to run as fast as possible, and games made with C++ are looking exactly for that.

Here’s a list of popular games made in C++:
Counter-Strike, 
Diablo 2,
 Doom
Grand Theft Auto
Mortal Kombat 11
Batman Arkham Origins
Fortnite
Splinter Cell
Unreal Tournament
Half-Life 2
Portal
Killing Floor
Left 4 Dead
Team Fortress
