Tech Tool for programming P5.js editor


The programmable tech tool I use is the P5js. editor. It is used so that my students can code using the  JavaScript language. I use it for my six sections of the Intro to Computer Science course that I teach. I use it to demonstrate code to students as well as for them to work on to create their own programs. I use this programming editor since its interface is a bit more user friendly for students that are doing programming for the first time.

The two tech tools I would recommend are LanSchool and EdPuzzle. They both have their advantages and disadvantages but in my opinion the pros out way the cons.

LanSchool helps teachers connect with students to create more meaningful online experiences, both in the classroom and remotely.

It helps instructors manage multiple student PCs in electronic classrooms from the instructor console. Using this tool, instructors can remotely control, monitor, share, and restrict, etc. student work stations in a lab environment.

Tech Tool 1: Lan School
A feature in LanSchool is Messaging. This helps me personalize learning.
As I try to personalize lessons for each student, it is important that my students can communicate their progress or questions that arise as they work. LanSchool’s messaging feature enables teachers to chat with students one-on-one or as a class, guiding and personalizing the learning experience.
Another good feature is Screen Monitoring. This helps me monitor student progress.
When students are all working on their own devices, teachers need digital tools that enable them to check on each student’s progress. Without LanSchool, this usually means walking around the room to glance at student’s screens, which only gives me a moment of context to figure out how everyone is doing. With LanSchool, teachers can use the t features to see in one place what all their students are working on.
This is crucial for recognizing when a student is not focusing or has misunderstood the assignment. Being able to pro-actively guide that student back to the right path can save the student time and energy and help them avoid unnecessary frustration. It can also help teachers get a better sense of each student’s working style. All these benefits are important in the classroom.
Some cons would be that some would consider the use of this software as an invasion of privacy. I would disagree with being that students should only be bringing up work that is school related and pertinent to the assignment given. Any personal information they open up is on them and should not have been accessed during class time. To be proactive you can deny students access to their email links and other websites such as YouTube so that they would not have access to them.
Another issue may have been the expense of the software which is about $250 per classroom.

2nd Tech tool:   EdPuzzle: 

I have used Edpuzzle for a while, but it became even much more vital as more of my content shifted online. Teachers use Edpuzzle to make video clips interactive by requiring student responses, which are easy to collect and assess.

My students learn the basic concepts of the lesson at home using Edpuzzle videos, which they can watch at their own pace. This gives me more time in the classroom to work on other activities that will reinforce students' understanding of the topic.
The variety of the lessons can be 
Videos can be taken from YouTube or directly uploaded
Open ended questions or notes can be put into the videos at any point
Students’ viewing of the video can also be tracked and graded.

Some cons would be it takes away from the in class direct contact with students. I feel EdPuzzle used as a tool in conjunction with the direct classroom experience is beneficial. It should not be used a replacement for the in class experience. That being stated the EdPuzzle tool was terrific when schools were shut down and remote learning was the only way any type of education was going on.
